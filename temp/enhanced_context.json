  "enhanced_context": "Based on KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) and ACR (American College of Radiology) guidelines, the patient’s eGFR of 59 mL/min/1.73m² indicates Unknown, suggesting chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increased risk from iodinated contrast exposure. Hypotension (MAP 59 mmHg) may exacerbate risks associated with contrast administration. The emergency admission context for Right-sided chest pain with history of diabetes and hypertension indicates time-sensitive imaging considerations. Existing clinical information was deemed sufficient, and no additional search was required. The ACR Manual on Contrast Media advises caution with contrast use, recommending hydration protocols and consideration of alternative imaging modalities when renal or hemodynamic risks are elevated."
