  "enhanced_context": "Based on KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) and ACR (American College of Radiology) guidelines, renal function (eGFR: Unknown) is not available, requiring verification before contrast administration.

Existing clinical information was deemed sufficient, and no additional search was required. The ACR Manual on Contrast Media advises caution with contrast use, recommending hydration protocols and consideration of alternative imaging modalities when renal or hemodynamic risks are elevated."
