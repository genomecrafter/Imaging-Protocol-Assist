  "enhanced_context": "Based on KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) and ACR (American College of Radiology) guidelines, the patient’s eGFR of 22.0 mL/min/1.73m² indicates Stage 4 (Severe CKD), with significant risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Hypotension (MAP 57.0 mmHg) may exacerbate risks associated with contrast administration. The emergency admission context for Shortness of breath, chest pain, history of diabetes and hypertension indicates time-sensitive imaging considerations. Existing clinical information was deemed sufficient, and no additional search was required. The ACR Manual on Contrast Media advises caution with contrast use, recommending hydration protocols and consideration of alternative imaging modalities when renal or hemodynamic risks are elevated."
