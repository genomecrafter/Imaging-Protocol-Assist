    "Order serum creatinine, BUN, and potassium immediately to assess renal function before contrast administration.",
    "If eGFR is adequate (>= 45 mL/min/1.73 m²), proceed with CT Pulmonary Angiography using weight-based contrast dosing (approx. 1.5 mL/kg, max 150 mL) and standardized hydration (1 mL/kg/h starting 12 hours before and continuing 12 hours after contrast).",
    "If eGFR is significantly reduced (30-44 mL/min/1.73 m²) or unavailable, consider reduced contrast volume (~0.8 mL/kg), low/iso-osmolar contrast, and aggressive hydration with close renal monitoring. If eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or labs remain unavailable, avoid iodinated contrast and consider V/Q scan or MR pulmonary angiography.",
    "Schedule repeat renal function testing 24-48 hours post-contrast administration."

    "Critical lack of renal function labs (creatinine, BUN, potassium) necessitates immediate ordering for safe contrast administration.",
    "Patient's clinical presentation (shortness of breath, chest pain) strongly suggests PE, making CTA a primary consideration, but dependent on renal function.",
    "Accurate contrast dosing requires patient weight and height, which are missing.",
    "Specific hydration protocols are required for optimal renal protection.",
    "Alternative imaging modalities must be considered in the presence of significant renal impairment or unavailable labs."
