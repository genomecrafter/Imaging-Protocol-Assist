  "recommendations": [
    "Obtain up-to-date renal function labs (eGFR, serum creatinine, BUN, potassium) with documented timestamps before any contrast-enhanced CT.",
    "Clarify the primary clinical question for imaging and the urgency (emergent vs. non-emergent).",
    "Defer contrast-enhanced CT until renal function is assessed; consider non-contrast CT or MRI if the study is non-emergent.",
    "If contrast-enhanced CT is emergent and renal function is available, select protocol based on eGFR thresholds and KDIGO guidelines."
  ],
  "rationale": [
    "Missing critical renal function data for safe contrast administration.",
    "Lack of clinical indication and urgency prevents appropriate protocol selection.",
    "Contrast administration is contraindicated or requires significant modification without known renal function.",
    "Selected protocols (LI-RADS and Trauma) are condition-specific and cannot be applied without indication."
