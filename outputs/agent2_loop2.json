    "If CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is absolutely essential and non-contrast alternatives are insufficient, implement aggressive pre-hydration with isotonic saline (if no contraindications like heart failure), use iso-osmolar, low-iodine concentration contrast, and administer the minimum effective volume. Correction of hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) must be prioritized before contrast administration.",
    "Consider bedside transthoracic echocardiography as an alternative to assess for right heart strain and rule out massive PE in the setting of hemodynamic instability, avoiding contrast entirely.",
    "If CTPA is performed, a low-dose, non-contrast CT chest protocol for lung cancer screening should NOT be selected as it is inappropriate for acute PE evaluation."
