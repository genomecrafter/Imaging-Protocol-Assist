    "Evaluate the clinical necessity of CTA PE by assessing pre-test probability (e.g., Wells score) and consider alternative imaging modalities like V/Q scan if suspicion is low or contrast administration is contraindicated.",
    "Obtain baseline renal labs immediately prior to contrast administration and plan for post-procedure creatinine monitoring (24-48 hours)."
