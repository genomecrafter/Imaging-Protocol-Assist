  "recommendations": [
    "Obtain STAT renal function labs (eGFR, serum creatinine, BUN, potassium) with precise timestamps. Do not proceed with contrast-enhanced imaging until this data is available.",
    "Clarify the primary clinical indication for imaging and document the urgency (emergent vs. non-emergent).",
    "If the indication is non-emergent, defer contrast-enhanced CT. Consider non-contrast CT, MRI without contrast, or ultrasound as alternatives.",
    "If the indication is emergent, proceed with contrast-enhanced CT using the lowest feasible iodine dose, split-bolus or reduced-volume techniques, and aggressive IV hydration according to KDIGO guidelines."

  "rationale": [
    "Critical missing renal function data (eGFR, creatinine, BUN, potassium) prevents safe contrast administration.",
    "Unclear clinical indication and urgency prevent appropriate protocol selection.",
    "Contrast administration without known renal function poses a significant risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.",
    "Placeholder patient data and references hinder definitive protocol selection and adherence to evidence-based standards."
